## Business Case: Evolving Business Model of SmileConnect

### Introduction

SmileConnect begins its journey as a non-profit organization focused on providing routine dental checkups in urban shelter areas in Ahmedabad. This initial phase involves collaborations with local non-profit organizations, colleges, and schools to establish a foundational service model. The goal is to evolve into a comprehensive dental service provider that integrates seamlessly with government-approved health record entities like Procto, enhancing data sharing and patient care across networks.

### Phase 1: Non-Profit Model in Urban Areas

**Objective**: Establish a foothold in urban areas by providing routine dental checkups in shelters and schools.

**Why**: This phase targets underserved populations in urban settings, where access to dental care is limited. Collaborating with educational institutions and shelters helps in reaching a large number of individuals in need, promoting oral health awareness and prevention.

**Cost and Value Creation**: Initial costs involve setting up mobile dental units and training staff. The value is created through improved community health and reduced future healthcare costs due to preventive care.

**Capital Sources**: Funding is primarily obtained from grants, donations, and partnerships with local non-profits and educational institutions.

### Phase 2: Integration with Health Record Entities

**Objective**: Transition into integrating services with health record systems like Procto to ensure seamless data sharing across providers.

**Why**: Integration with health record systems ensures that dental health data contributes to overall patient health profiles, facilitating better treatment decisions and continuity of care.

**Cost and Value Creation**: Costs will increase due to the need for advanced IT systems and training for data handling. The value lies in enhanced service efficiency, improved patient outcomes, and the ability to track health trends over time.

**Capital Sources**: As the organization evolves, it may start generating revenue from service fees, which along with continued donations and grants, will fund this phase.

### Phase 3: Mobile Dental Checkups for Remote Areas

**Objective**: Expand services to include mobile dental checkups in remote areas, reaching underserved populations outside urban centers.

**Why**: Many residents in remote areas lack access to any form of dental care. Mobile units can bridge this gap, providing essential services and preventing severe dental diseases.

**Cost and Value Creation**: The deployment of mobile dental units involves logistical costs but creates significant value by preventing advanced dental diseases, which are more costly to treat.

**Capital Sources**: Funding for mobile units can come from a mix of government support, continued non-profit funding, and potentially a fee-for-service model for areas that can afford to pay a subsidized rate.

### Long-Term Vision: Full Integration and Expansion

**Objective**: Fully integrate dental services with national health records and expand the range of services offered, including advanced treatments and surgeries.

**Why**: Full integration with health records and expanded services will position SmileConnect as a comprehensive dental care provider, improving access and quality of care across the board.

**Cost and Value Creation**: This phase will require significant investment in equipment, training, and systems integration. The value is realized through a robust service offering that can attract a wider patient base and potentially operate on a hybrid non-profit/for-profit model.

**Capital Sources**: At this stage, SmileConnect might attract investment from private sectors, form partnerships with healthcare providers, or engage in public-private partnerships to fund expansion.

### Conclusion

The evolving business model of SmileConnect represents a strategic approach to expanding dental care services in a phased manner, starting from a non-profit base and moving towards integration with broader healthcare systems. Each phase builds on the previous one, gradually adding capabilities and expanding reach, while ensuring that the organization remains financially viable and true to its mission of providing accessible dental care.
